# Innovativeness-needs Paradox

People who need the benefits of an innovation are often the last to adopt it

* contraceptives
* computers

Does wealth enable early adoption? Or does early adoption cause wealth?

* greater wealth goes to the early adopters
    * Microsoft
* greater risk

# Innovation Dimensions

Adoption and implementation take place on at least two levels - organizational and individual

Radical versus incremental

Product versus process

Voluntary versus involuntary

Push/pull considerations

Marketplace versus marketspace

# Consequences of Innovation

Consequences are changes that occur or an individual or a social system as the result of the adoption or rejection of an innovation

Why haven't they been studied more?

## Pro-innovation bias

* Change agents overemphasize adoption tacitly assuming that the consequences of innovation decisions will be positive
* Change agents assume that innovation is needed by their clients

* Usual survey research methods may be inappropriate for the investigation of innovation consequence
    * Typical survey research versus participant observation

* Consequences are difficult to measure
    * Cultural relativism

## Classification of consequences

* Desirable versus undesirable consequences
    * Assumption of separability
* Direct versus indirect
* Anticipated versus unanticipated
