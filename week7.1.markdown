# Innovation Characteristics

Several ways to characterize innovations

Everett Rogers refers to:

* Relative Advantage
* Compatibility
* Complexity
* Trialability
* Observability

Key factor is how these characteristics are perceived by the potential adopter
    Perception above reality
    As seen through the eyes of a potential adopter


## Relative Advantage

The degree to which an innovation is perceived as better than the idea it
supersedes

* Economics
* Preventative vs incremental
* Innovations
* Incentives
* Adopter vs diffuser
* Monetary or not
* Immediate or delayed
* Positive or negative

### Are incentives good or bad?

Incentives help achieve diffusion but often without commitment

## Compatibility

The degree to which an innovation is perceived as consistent with existing
values, past experiences and needs of potential adopters

* Values and beliefs
* Previously introduced ideas
* Needs
* Norms
    * Name
    * Positioning

## Complexity

The degree to which an innovation is perceived as relatively difficult to
understand and to use

* Understanding
* Use
* Peer influence

## Trialability

The degree to which an innovation may be experimented with on a limited basis

* Piecemeal
* Returnable

## Observability

The degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others

* Tangible
* Intangible
* Social prestige
    * Overadoption
* Priorities
* Watch out for reverse-observability
