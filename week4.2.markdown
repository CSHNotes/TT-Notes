    * Resistors

# Consequences

* First order
    * Did it solve the immediate problem?
* Second order
    * Did it create more?

# Two Paradigms

## Technology Push

Science -> Technology -> Solved Problem

## Demand Pull

Problem -> Technology -> Knowledge

## Putting it together

    *Technology Push*                                   *Demand Pull*

# Products and processes

## Products

* Objects
* Machines
* Tangible things
* Process

## Processes

* Systems of people and products
* Systems of tasks performed by people
* Systems of tasks performed by machines
* Specifications for performing taks

## Together

* Processes make better products 
    * Manufacturing improvements
* Processes are often embedded in products
    * X-ray machine that embeds the process of X-raying within it
* Products are often part of a process
    * Improved sales technique might involve use of a computer/smartphone
* Processes tend to be more systemic and cause disruption to existing systems
    * TQM (Total quality management)
    * Learning environments

## Continuous Improvment

* Kaizen Principle
    * Human resources are a company's most important asset
    * Processes must evolve gradually, not with radical changes
    * Improvement must be based on statistical/quantitative evaluation of
        process/performance
    * Based on principles espoused by Demming and Juran
        * Have a plan
        * Implement it
        * Evaluate it

## Radical vs. Incremental

* Another way to categorize innovations
* Radical innovations represent big steps
* Incremental represent small steps
